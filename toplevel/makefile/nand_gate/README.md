## NAND GATE example

Beside, the three basic logic gates (AND, OR and NOT) there are other two universal gates ***(NAND and NOR)*** and two other logic gates ***Ex-OR and EX-NOR***.
***NAND*** gate can have many inputs (it can be two or more than two inputs) and one output.
Basically, it is AND gate followed by NOT gate. 
The output of the ***NAND*** gate is 0 if all inputs are 1 else it is 1.
The truth table of 2-input ***NAND*** gate is given below:
